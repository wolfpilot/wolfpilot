# [wolfpilot.co.uk](http://www.wolfpilot.co.uk)

Source code of my Jekyll-based portfolio website.

The compiled version can be found in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/wolfpilot/wolfpilot/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Build setup

To run the site locally, you'll first need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). After that:

- Clone this repo and CD into it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `gulp serve` to start up the server and launch a BrowserSync instance
